# FST06

Within the FST06 repository, I have completed a series of tasks organized into eight subfolders. These tasks include mastering Git fundamentals such as branching, merging, and collaboration, setting up and managing remote repositories on GitHub, and building HTML pages focusing on typography, lists, anchors, images, and forms. Additionally, I have explored core CSS techniques including selectors, padding, margins, borders, positioning, Flexbox, Grid Layout, and media queries for responsive design. I also gained practical experience with JavaScript, specifically in functions, arrays, and DOM manipulation.
